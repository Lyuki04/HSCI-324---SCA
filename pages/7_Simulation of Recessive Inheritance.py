- In this simulation, the disease allele (**a**) is **recessive**, meaning that **two copies** of the allele are required to express the disease phenotype.
- Therefore, **only homozygous (aa)** individuals are considered affected, while **heterozygous carriers (Aa)** do **not** experience symptoms.
- The fitness of these individuals is defined using the selection coefficient `s`:
  - `w_aa = 1 - s`  (two disease alleles; affected)
  - `w_Aa = 1`      (one disease allele; unaffected carrier)
  - `w_AA = 1`      (no disease alleles; unaffected)

This setup represents **recessively inherited disorders** like certain types of **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)**, where individuals can unknowingly carry and pass on the allele without being affected themselves.

Although selection can act against individuals who are homozygous for the disease allele, the allele may still persist in the population ‚Äî **hidden in carriers**. Combined with **genetic drift**, especially in small populations, this can lead to unpredictable outcomes: the allele might **disappear**, **persist**, or even **increase in frequency** over time.

This component of the model helps us explore how **"silent" inheritance patterns** interact with evolutionary forces like drift and selection.
