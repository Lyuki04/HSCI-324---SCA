| What is Genetic Drift?            | Random changes in gene frequencies over time.                                 |
| Why Does it Matter for SCA?       | Increases the prevalence of disease-causing mutations, especially in small populations. |
| Impact on Small Populations       | Random events have a larger impact on gene frequency in small groups.         |
| SCA and Genetic Drift             | SCA mutations can become more common in small, isolated populations by chance. |
| Dominant vs Recessive Inheritance  | Dominant mutations are more easily impacted by genetic drift, and recessive mutations can persist in carriers. |

        - **Genetic drift** is a random process where gene frequencies change in a population due to chance.
        - Genetic drift doesn't depend on whether a gene provides a survival advantage.
        - More pronounced in **small populations**.
        - Over time, some genes may become **more or less common**, or even disappear entirely.

    st.markdown("""
        - **Founder effect**: When a small group of individuals from a larger population start a new population, their genetic traits can become more common in future generations due to genetic drift.
        - **Bottleneck effect**: After a major population reduction, the gene pool is limited, and certain genes may become overrepresented due to genetic drift.

with st.expander("Why Does Genetic Drift Matter for Diseases?"):
    st.markdown("""
        - In diseases like **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)**, genetic drift can impact how the disease-causing gene is passed down.
        - **In small or isolated populations**, genetic drift can increase or decrease the frequency of the SCA gene by chance.
        - This could make it more likely for future generations to inherit the disease-causing mutation, even if the mutation has no survival advantage.

with st.expander("How Does Genetic Drift Affect Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)?"):
    st.markdown("""
        - SCA mutations are passed down through generations, but **genetic drift** can cause the frequency of the disease-causing mutation to rise or fall, especially in **small or isolated communities**.
        - By chance, these mutations can spread in the population, or conversely, they can diminish or disappear completely over time.
        - Over generations, this can make the disease more prevalent or even lessen its impact depending on random fluctuations.

with st.expander("Why is Genetic Drift More Pronounced in Small Populations?"):
    st.markdown("""
        - In **small populations**, random events (like who mates with whom) can drastically change gene frequencies.
        - In large populations, the effects of genetic drift are less noticeable because of the **larger gene pool**.
        - In small populations, genetic drift can rapidly increase or decrease the frequency of the SCA gene, depending on the random events at play.

    | **Factor**                      | **Dominant Inheritance**                                  | **Recessive Inheritance**                                      |
    |----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | **Expression of Mutation**       | Only **one copy** of the mutated gene is needed to express the disease. | **Two copies** of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are needed for expression. |
    | **Impact of Genetic Drift**      | More **prone to changes** in frequency because any individual with one copy of the mutation can express the disease. | **More stable** in the population because carriers (heterozygotes) donâ€™t show symptoms, and the gene can persist at low frequencies. |
    | **Prevalence Change**            | **Can increase or decrease** rapidly in the population since the mutation can be expressed in heterozygotes. | Mutations can **remain in the population** for longer periods without expressing the disease, but can still decrease over generations. |
    | **Effect on Population**         | Changes in the gene frequency are **immediately visible** because the mutation expresses in individuals with one copy. | Effects of genetic drift are **slower to be visible**, as carriers may carry the gene without expressing symptoms. |
    | **Persistence in the Population**| Dominant mutations **donâ€™t persist** as long at low frequencies because they are expressed sooner. | Recessive mutations can **persist for longer** in carriers without being expressed, even at low frequencies. |
