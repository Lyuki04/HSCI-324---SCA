To create this simulation I expanded upon the basic **Wright-Fisher model** to study the evolution of a dominantly inherited **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)**. Here's how it works:

    st.markdown("""
- Models the **fitness cost** of the disease.

    st.markdown("""

""")

with st.expander("üë• Dominant Inheritance Model"):
    st.markdown("""
- In this simulation, the disease allele (**A**) is **dominant**, meaning that **just one copy** of the allele is enough to express the disease phenotype.
- Therefore, **both heterozygous (Aa)** and **homozygous (AA)** individuals are considered affected.
- The fitness of these individuals is **reduced** by a selection coefficient `s`:
  - `w_AA = 1 - s`  (two disease alleles)
  - `w_Aa = 1 - s`  (one disease allele)
  - `w_aa = 1`      (no disease alleles; full fitness)

This approach reflects **dominantly inherited disorders** like **Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA)**, where symptoms can manifest even if only one parent passes on the mutation.

In a population, natural selection may act **against** carriers of the disease allele, reducing its frequency over time. However, due to **genetic drift**, especially in small populations, the allele can still persist or even become fixed ‚Äî despite its disadvantage.

This component of the model allows us to explore the **tension between selection and randomness**, helping to visualize how a dominant disease gene behaves across generations.
