st.markdown("""
### How Genetic Drift Affects the Disease Allele Frequency

Genetic drift is the random fluctuation of allele frequencies over time, especially in small populations. In the Wright-Fisher model, this effect is due to the random sampling of alleles each generation, where alleles can be lost or fixed due to chance alone.

For **dominant inheritance**, individuals with a **dominant allele (A)** exhibit the disease even if they are heterozygous (Aa). Genetic drift can significantly impact the frequency of this allele, especially when the initial frequency is low or the population is small. This is because chance events may cause the dominant allele to be lost or fixed, even if there is a selective advantage to having it.
