Inheritance patterns determine how genetic traits or diseases are passed down from parents to offspring. Two common inheritance patterns are **autosomal dominant** and **autosomal recessive** inheritance.

|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Affected Genotypes**                     | - Homozygous dominant (AA) or heterozygous (Aa) individuals express the trait | - Only homozygous recessive (aa) individuals express the trait |
| **Carrier Individuals**                    | - N/A | Heterozygous (Aa) individuals are carriers but do not show the trait |
| **Trait Expression**                       | - One copy of the dominant allele is sufficient to express the trait | Both copies of the recessive allele must be present for the trait to be expressed |
| **Inheritance Pattern**                    | - There is a **50% chance** of passing the dominant allele to each child if one parent is affected (heterozygous or homozygous dominant)| - The trait is passed on only when both parents are carriers or affected |

    - **One copy of the dominant allele (A)** is enough for an individual to express the dominant trait. 
    - Individuals with the genotype **AA** (homozygous dominant) or **Aa** (heterozygous) will show the disease or trait.
    - There is a **50% chance** of passing the dominant allele to each child if one parent is affected (heterozygous or homozygous dominant).
    - **No carriers** in the classic senseâ€”individuals who inherit the dominant allele will express the trait.

    st.markdown("""
    - **Two copies of the recessive allele (aa)** are required for the individual to express the recessive trait.
    - Individuals with **AA** or **Aa** genotypes do not express the trait but may be carriers if they have the **Aa** genotype.
    - Both parents must be carriers or affected for a child to inherit two copies of the recessive allele and express the disease.
    - **Carrier individuals** (Aa) do not show the trait but have a 50% chance of passing the recessive allele to their children.
